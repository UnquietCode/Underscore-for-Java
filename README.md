Underscore-for-Java
===================

An experiment with porting [Underscore.js](https://github.com/documentcloud/underscore) to Java. A smarter, fluent API would probably be much better
and easier to use.

Perhaps FlumeJava is a more polished alternative?

Anyway, we all do strange things when we're bored.



Peace, love, and code.
